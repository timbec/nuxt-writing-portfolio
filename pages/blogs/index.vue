            <p>Starting in 2006, when I lived on the now-demolished Heygate Estate in London's Elephand and Castle, I
                kept
                two blogs: Live From the Heygate, then City of Strangers</p>
            <p>After I moved to New York City, I updated the Heygate blog with the latest news as the estate was emptied
                out
                then readied for demolition, and modified City of Strangers for NYC, focusing mostly on a literary take
                on
                every day life.</p>
