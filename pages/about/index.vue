                    <p>I write mostly fiction, some journalism, a couple of essays. I've been published in Granta, the
                        Guardian, Urban Graffiti, Sensitive Skin Magazine and a few other places.</p>
                    <p> After taking a sabbatical
                        from writing, I'm back at it. What else am I going to do? I also write code and am building this
                        site as I go. </p>
